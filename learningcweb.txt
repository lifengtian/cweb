I saw special words like
@     begining of section
@*	begining of star * section
@d	define
@<	begining of a named section
@>	end of a named section
@c   beginning of an unamed section
@p
@s motion int @s action int
@s not normal @q unreverse a C++ keyword @>

@^
@c@=
@#
@+
@!
@/
+=
\
||
$c$

a section of cweb doc include (must) 3 parts:
first TeX part
second macro definitions
third  C

section has to begin with @  or @*
middle part begins with @d or @f
C part begins with @c or @<section name@>=
  it has a name specified by @<   @> you can use @<Clear...@> to refer
  to the named section
  The same section name can appear multiple places. 

@d may be scattered around, but will be collected and defined at the
beginning of the C program by ctangle
C parts of unnamed sections are copied down in order of writing in
cweb file; There should be at least one unnamed section, otherwise
there will be no program.
