I saw special words (or control code) like
@     begining of section
@*	begining of star * section -- a new page starts
@d	define
@<	begining of a named section
@>	end of a named section
@c  beginning of an unamed C section
@p  beginning of 'program'
@s motion int @s action int
@s not normal @q unreverse a C++ keyword @>
@( output to a new file
@^
@c@=
@#
@+  no newline
@!


8 for TeX readability only
@;   
@,
@|
@#
@+
@/
@[  
@]




+=
\
||
$c$

a section of cweb doc must include 3 parts:
1. first  part: TeX part, explanation
2. second part: macro definitions
3. third  part: C, a piece of program.

section has to begin with @  or @*
middle part begins with @d or @f
C part begins with @c or @<section name@>=
  it has a name specified by @<   @> you can use @<Clear...@> to refer
  to the named section
  The same section name can appear multiple places. 

@d may be scattered around, but will be collected and defined at the
beginning of the C program by ctangle
C parts of unnamed sections are copied down in order of writing in
cweb file; There should be at least one unnamed section, otherwise
there will be no program.

@ This is a subroutine

@<Sub...@>=
int score (void);
