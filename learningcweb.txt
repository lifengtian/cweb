A CWEB program is a C program that has been cut up into pieces and rearranged into an order that is easier for a human being to understand.
A C program is a CWEB program that has been rearranged into an order that is easier for a computer to understand. 
--- Stanford GraphBase

"You should be able to understand a C program better when you see it in its CWEB form, if the 
author of the CWEB form has chosen a good order of presentation. "

Tangle
  ctangle transform the CWEB program to a ordinary C program
  
Weave
  cweave convert the CWEB program to human readable document
  

List of special words (or control code):
@   begining of section
@*	begining of star * section -- a new page starts
@d	define
@<	begining of a named section
@>	end of a named section
@c  beginning of an unamed C section
@p  beginning of 'program'
@s  not normal @q unreverse a C++ keyword @>
@(  output to a new file. e.g., @(gb_graph.h@>=
@^
@c@=
@#
@+  no newline
@!


8 for TeX readability only
@;   
@,
@|
@#
@+
@/
@[  
@]

+=
\
||
$c$


A section of cweb doc must include 3 parts:
  1. first  part: TeX part, informal commentary
  2. second part: macro definitions
  3. third  part: C code
and these parts always occur in the stated order. In practice, the individual parts are sometimes empty.

A section is either named or unnamed. 

A section has to begin with @  or @*

middle part begins with @d or @f

C part begins with @c or @<section name@>=
  it has a name specified by @<   @> you can use @<Clear...@> to refer
  to the named section
  The same section name can appear multiple places. 

@d may be scattered around, but will be collected and defined at the
beginning of the C program by ctangle
C parts of unnamed sections are copied down in order of writing in
cweb file; There should be at least one unnamed section, otherwise
there will be no program.

e.g.
@ This is a subroutine

@<Sub...@>=
int score (void);


Cweave will produce a human friendly typographically formatted typeset document such that
raw C code becomes easier to read. For example, program structure is shown by indentation.

Sometimes the name of a section is a file name in typewriter type, such as <gb_save.h 1>.
This means that the replacement text for that section is output to the named file instead of being part
of the tangled C code. A single program document can therefore describe several related files.
